I am a researcher in computer science. My main thematic is the trace visualization.
More specifically, my work focuses on designing scalable visualizations that enable the analysis of complex embedded and parallel systems.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)](https://www.bsc.es/), within the performance tools team.

I used to be a contractual researcher at [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/), from February 2012 to May 2015, within the [MOAIS](http://moais.imag.fr/) team.
My research was funded by the [SoC-Trace](http://www.minalogic.com/TPL_CODE/TPL_PROJET/PAR_TPL_IDENTIFIANT/2717/15-annuaire-innovations-technologiques-nanotechnologie-systeme-embarque.htm) project, which gathers academic partners such as [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/), [UJF](https://www.ujf-grenoble.fr/), [LIG](https://www.liglab.fr/), and industrial companies, like [STMicroelectronics](http://www.st.com/), [ProbaYes](http://www.probayes.com/), and [Magillem](http://www.magillem.com/).
I was also involved in the [SONGS](http://infra-songs.gforge.inria.fr/) project, and within the [LICIA](http://licia-lab.org/index-en.html), an international laboratory, which joins French and Brazilian academic partners. 
In parallel, I taught in [Polytech'Grenoble](http://www.polytech-grenoble.fr) engineering school.

I also was involved in the [Geomedia Project](http://www.gis-cist.fr/axes-scientifiques/geomedia/) during October 2015, for a short term contract, within the [CIST](http://www.gis-cist.fr/) laboratory and [University Paris Descartes](http://www.parisdescartes.fr/). I provided an expertise on the RSS news collect platform which was previsously developped within this project.

I hold a Ph.D. (2015) in Computer Science, from [University of Grenoble](http://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/), as well as a Master's degree (2011) in Computer Science, specialty in [Architecture and Integrated System Design](http://www-master.ufr-info-p6.jussieu.fr/lmd/specialite/sesi/) and a Bachelor's degree (2009) in [Electronics](http://www.licence.elec.upmc.fr/), both from [University Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC)](http://www.upmc.fr/), France.
