I am a Ph.D student at [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/) since February 2012, within the [MOAIS](http://moais.imag.fr/) team.
My main thematic is the trace visualization.
More specifically, my work focuses on designing scalable visualizations that enable the analysis of complex embedded and parallel systems.
My research is currently funded by the [SoC-Trace](http://www.minalogic.com/TPL_CODE/TPL_PROJET/PAR_TPL_IDENTIFIANT/2717/15-annuaire-innovations-technologiques-nanotechnologie-systeme-embarque.htm) project, which gathers academic partners such as [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/), [UJF](https://www.ujf-grenoble.fr/), [LIG](https://www.liglab.fr/), and industrial companies, like [STMicroelectronics](http://www.st.com/), [ProbaYes](http://www.probayes.com/), and [Magillem](http://www.magillem.com/).
I am also involved in the [SONGS](http://infra-songs.gforge.inria.fr/) project, and within the [LICIA](http://licia-lab.org/index-en.html), an international laboratory, which joins French and Brazilian academic partners. 
In parallel, I teach in [Polytech'Grenoble](http://www.polytech-grenoble.fr) engineering school. 

I hold a Master degree (2011) in Computer Science, specialty in [Architecture and Integrated System Design](http://www-master.ufr-info-p6.jussieu.fr/lmd/specialite/sesi/) and a Bachelor degree (2009) in [Electronics](http://www.licence.elec.upmc.fr/), both from [UPMC](http://www.upmc.fr/), France.
