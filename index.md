I am a researcher in computer science, in the performance analysis domain. My work focuses on ways to analyze application execution traces, through methods based on aggregation, visualization, and interaction.

I currently hold a postdoctoral researcher position at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)](https://www.bsc.es/) since December 2015, within the performance tools team. This team designed several tools commonly used by the HPC community to trace and analyze their programs (Extrae, Paraver) or simulate parallel systems (Dimemas).

I used to be a Ph.D. student at [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/), from February 2012 to May 2015, within the [MOAIS](http://moais.imag.fr/) team. I designed visualization methods to analyze huge traces, using aggregation methods involving information theory concepts, and designed and developped a tool, Ocelotl, which implements these methods.
My research was funded by the [SoC-Trace](http://www.minalogic.com/TPL_CODE/TPL_PROJET/PAR_TPL_IDENTIFIANT/2717/15-annuaire-innovations-technologiques-nanotechnologie-systeme-embarque.htm) project, which gathers academic partners such as [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/), [UJF](https://www.ujf-grenoble.fr/), [LIG](https://www.liglab.fr/), and industrial companies, like [STMicroelectronics](http://www.st.com/), [ProbaYes](http://www.probayes.com/), and [Magillem](http://www.magillem.com/).
I was also involved in the [SONGS](http://infra-songs.gforge.inria.fr/) project, and within the [LICIA](http://licia-lab.org/index-en.html), an international laboratory, which joins French and Brazilian academic partners. 
In parallel, I taught in [Polytech'Grenoble](http://www.polytech-grenoble.fr) engineering school.

I also worked in the [Geomedia](http://www.gis-cist.fr/axes-scientifiques/geomedia/) project during October 2015, within the [CIST](http://www.gis-cist.fr/) laboratory and [University Paris Descartes](http://www.parisdescartes.fr/). I provided an expertise on the RSS news collect platform which was previously developped within this project.

I hold a Ph.D. (2015) in Computer Science, from [University of Grenoble](http://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/), as well as a Master's degree (2011) in Computer Science, specialty in [Architecture and Integrated System Design](http://www-master.ufr-info-p6.jussieu.fr/lmd/specialite/sesi/) and a Bachelor's degree (2009) in [Electronics](http://www.licence.elec.upmc.fr/), both from [University Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC)](http://www.upmc.fr/), France.
