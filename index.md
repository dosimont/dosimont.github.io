I am Damien Dosimont, Ph.D student in Computer Science since February 2012 at the [National Institute of Research for Computer Sciences and Control Engineering](http://www.inria.fr/centre/grenoble) (Inria) and the [Joseph Fourier University](http://www.ujf-grenoble.fr) (UJF), in Grenoble, France.

I work in the [MOAIS](http://moais.imag.fr) research team, on the industrial project [SoC-Trace](http://www.minalogic.com/TPL_CODE/TPL_PROJET/PAR_TPL_IDENTIFIANT/2717/15-annuaire-innovations-technologiques-nanotechnologie-systeme-embarque.htm), in partnership with the [MESCAL](http://mescal.imag.fr) team (INRIA), the [LIG](http://www.liglab.fr) laboratory and [STMicroelectronics](http://www.st.com/internet/com/home/home.jsp).
My thesis subject is about the visualization of traces provided by embedded systems softwares execution. My works are mainly focused on aggregation and interaction solutions, which will allow the analyst to deal with big amounts of data and screen limitations. In parallel, I give teachings to [Polytech'Grenoble](http://www.polytech-grenoble.fr) engineer school students.
